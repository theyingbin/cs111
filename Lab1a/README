Limitations
+++++++++++
I could not get the program to exit immediately after the shell sends an EOF back.
Instead, my program takes input from the user and once the user hits submits, the
program exits with error code 1. This is due to the fact when the shell sent the EOF,
the terminal is still reading input from the user.

Features
++++++++
My program takes input charcter at a time in no echo mode and writes back what the user typed.
With the --shell option, my program creates a new process that takes input from the user and
forwards it to the shell. The shell then gives my program the output which is then interpreted
and if no signals occured, is written onto screen. Upon recieving a ^D ^C or EOF, my program behaves
as according to the spec by sending various signals, restoring terminal modes,  and exiting with
different error codes.

Testing
+++++++
To test my program, I worked incrementally and tested it as I added new features.

My TA Tuan Le demonstrated to me how I can change the modes of the program.
He also demonstrated how I can change my process to run the shell.
