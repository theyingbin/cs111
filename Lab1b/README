Makefile - file to make client and server. also makes the submission and supports clean
README - (this file) describes what I did for project 1b and its limitations/features/testing methodology/etc

Features
++++++++
My program takes input characters as the client and sends them over to the server, which processes it in the shell process and sends the result back to the client.
With the --log option, my program tracks what is sent and received from the server.
With the --encrypt option, my program encrypts a message before sending it to the server and decrypts it before receiving it

+++++++
Testing
+++++++
To test my program, I worked incrementally and tested it as I added new features such as adding support for the --log option and the --encrypt option.

I used the socket tutorial to learn how to program sockets to get started. I modified the code provided by the socket tutroial in the spec to get started on my server.c. I looked at the examples on tutorialspoint to get started on my client.c.
I looked at the man page for mcrypt to understand how to encrypt my messages and incorporated that into my program.
